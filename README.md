# OpenSavannah's first-annual "CityCampSAV" event and participation period an ideal candidate for Weave-a-Dream funding
> What better way to promote local arts and cultural affairs than convening an inclusive cross-sector of traditionally-siloed residents from *all* neighborhoods together for a day of creative solutions-building – wielding innovative public feedback mechanisms created *by* and *with* the community, rather than *for* it by the City?

[OpenSavannah](Https://opensavannah.org)'s inaugural solutions-based, resident-driven one-day summit/unconference, "CityCampSAV," is slated for Oct. 13, 2018, in partnership with the City of Savannah and with sponsorships from The Creative Coast, ProjectMQ, Enmarket, Code for America, and ReformGeorgia. While the event is a partnership, OpenSavanna

Furthermore, the ensuing feedback period aims at *true* inclusivity of underrepresented groups through innovative online and offline mechanisms. Neighborhoods with less representation in high-poverty areas will be prioritized in the outreach process and their responses weighted more heavily as a means of compensating for historic inequity in participation. Community revitalization is a top priority of this equity-focused process to align resident values with government services.

*Moreovoer, in no way is the event and ensuing feedback process a way for The City to purchase services solely for its own benefit.* In fact, it's taken significant advocacy and trust-building on our part as volunteer residents just to convince leaders to adopt a more modern and more innovative approach to public participation. We value innovation, but we value *civic* innovation even more because it improves the lives of everyone, starting with those who live in the margins of our communities.

CityCampSAV is based on the [CityCamp](http://citycamp.com) model successfully implemented in other cities.

## 1. Meets Weave-A-Dream Requirements
*By educating and by empowering residents of all backgrounds and ages, this project more than fulfills Weave-A-Dream priorities.*

### A. Has a strong youth focus central to project

>The primary digital artifact of this project is mobile and desktop budget simulation game that can be played by anyone, but is designed chiefly for use in classroom settings to explain the budget to high-school or middle-school age students.


Called "Savannah Budget.Party," OpenSavannah volunteers who also work as educators in the SCCPS have already developed a [detailed curriculum around the process](https://cvlassets.s3.amazonaws.com/Budget.Game.Binder.pdf).

Given that the aim of the SavannahBudgetParty app is to make municipal budgeting more accessible – and to engage younger residents who traditionally have not taken part in public deliberation with their local government – we believe this successfully meets the requirements of the youth focus. 

### B. Aims to revitalize neighborhoods by empowering their voices in budget process

The feedback component of this project seeks to strengthen neighborhoods to speak up for the issues their communities face. It radically seeks to attempt to bring catalytic change at scale through bottom-up solutions created with, not *for*, residents. See: Asset-based community development and Savannah's "Grants for Blocks" program.



## 2. Community-Powered Innovation in Government

While the private sector has underwent a profound digital revolution in the last two decades, the public sector has largely gone unchanged. *As citizens, we cannot afford to leave our government behind.* If we continue to apply 20th century processes to the governance of a 21st century society, we'll continue to breed public cynicism and miscommunication. If we give up on government, we give up on ourselves 

With public trust in government at historic lows, it's easy to blame partisan gridlock at the federal level.

## 3. Shift in Community Perception on Technology, Design

Too many residents feel disempowered by the digital revolution, and we aim to change that mentality through this project. 

## 4. A Path Toward a Fully Participatory Budgeting Process

## 5. Engagement of local graphic designers, UX developers, data visualization designers for civic good

From project management, to event planning, to journey mapping, to data analysis, to process design, to creative-problem solving generally, CityCampSAV and the post-event feedback period give local residents an opportunity to put their skills to use for tangible civic good on stuff that matters. 

## 6. An Intentional Focus on Intercultural, Cross-Sector Exchange of Ideas

Prior to the event, OpenSavannah volunteers will canvass and recruit residents to participate, starting with residents from neighborhoods traditionally underrepresented in city decision-making. Ideally, one of OpenSavannah's 23 neighborhood ambassadors will be able to speak at a meeting of their local neighborhood association. For those associations we miss, we will During the afternoon lightning talk sessions, 

## 7. Promotes innovative thinking to help catalyze systems-change

An undergirding community value for CityCampSAV is that innovative ideas or approaches to municipal governance and citizen participation can potentially lead to greater efficiency, less redundancy, greater equity, and better outcomes for all residents.

## 8. Strengthens neighborhood bonds and empowers residents to use their voice and hands to bring the change they wish to see


## 9. Uses participatory art and design methodologies to bridge intercultural and/or city-citizen divides
